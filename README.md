# ruke

This is a dataframe implementation for Rhombus that is based on the Racket
dataframe library I have been working on called
[`uke`](https://github.com/samdphillips/uke).

Goals (same as `uke`):
- immutable indexes, series, and dataframes
- minimize copying of storage for series

Additional goals:
- exercise Rhombus
- discover how this could work in Rhombus
- examine if there could be a single code base between the two projects
